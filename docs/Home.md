The documentation for this API is provided here. All documentation currently refers to the `v1` version of the API.

Articles are grouped by the resources they describe. Most articles describe the endpoints associated with a specific resource, providing sample requests and responses, as well as required headers or required parameters. The errors that may be returned by an endpoint are listed when applicable.

Some articles may describe a resource that is not associated with a single entity. For example, the Errors Documentation only provides an overview of the different types of errors returned by the API, but not the specific endpoints that may return each of those errors.
